## FAQ

**Q: Why doesn’t quoting work on some pages?**  
A: Extensions can’t access certain protected or internal pages (e.g., about:, chrome:, edge:) due to browser security restrictions.

**Q: Can I change the keyboard shortcut?**  
A: Yes! Go to your browser’s extension manager > Manage Extension Shortcuts to set your preferred shortcut.

**Q: Why does the context menu not appear?**  
A: The context menu is only available in editable fields (like email compose boxes or rich text editors).

**Q: Does this extension work on Firefox for Android?**  
A: No, due to platform limitations, only desktop Firefox is supported.
