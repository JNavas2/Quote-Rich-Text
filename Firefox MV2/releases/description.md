**FAQ**

- **Why doesn’t quoting work on some pages?**  
  Extensions can’t access certain protected or internal pages (e.g., about:, chrome:, edge:) due to browser security restrictions.

- **Can I change the keyboard shortcut?**  
  Yes! Go to your browser’s extension manager > Manage Extension Shortcuts to set your preferred shortcut.

- **Why does the context menu not appear?**  
  The context menu is only available in editable fields (like email compose boxes or rich text editors).

- **Does this extension work on Firefox for Android?**  
  No, only desktop Firefox is supported.

**Known Issues**
- Does not work on internal or restricted browser pages.
- Some web editors may block or override extension actions.
- Only works in rich text (contenteditable) editors, not plain text fields.

**Privacy**
- Quote Rich Text does *not* collect, store, or share any personal data.
- No tracking, no analytics, no ads—just quoting.
